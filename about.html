        Bloom is a fairly new boba tea shop in Newark, California, founded in 2025 by a Taiwanese couple, Mei and Mung Lin.
        Born and raised in Taichung — the birthplace of boba tea — Mei and Mung’s story began long before Bloom. After meeting in
        their hometown and building a life together, they moved to California in search of better opportunities and education for their daughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once settled, they longed to share a piece of Taichung’s tea culture with their new community. They noticed that while milk tea shops
        were everywhere, many relied on artificial powders and excessive sugars — masking the true essence of premium tea. Determined to bring
        authenticity back to the cup, the Lins founded Bloom with a mission to serve high-quality drinks that highlight the natural fragrance
        of real tea leaves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through their dedication to fresh ingredients, craftsmanship, and genuine hospitality, Bloom has quickly become a local favorite — a place
        where every sip tells a story. Their growing community of customers continues to inspire them, shaping the very values that Bloom stands for today!
